# .emacs
This is my emacs configuration. Included are the packages that I've installed from source. Simply copy these into your
~/.emacs.d for simple installation. Packages included in init.el that are not in this repo need to be installed from MELPA.
I reccommend Emacs Prelude for beginner emacs users.
